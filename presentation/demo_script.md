## Questions to Ask Levi at 9:00 AM

**Q1 — Most important**
> "Levi, when you picture the ideal output of this system — is it the
> interviewer brief, or the structured intelligence schema that feeds
> your knowledge graph over time? Which matters more long-term?"

**Q2**
> "Do you have any notes or transcripts from past interviews we could
> seed as institutional memory for the demo today?"

**Q3**
> "You mentioned the interviewee should do zero work — when you send
> them something before the call, what's the most important thing that
> communication should accomplish?"

**Q4**
> "The cases you gave us each end with Document 4 — the Texas Insights
> Schema. Is that the output format you want, or is it illustrative?"

## Demo Script — 4 Minutes 30 Seconds

---

### Opening (45 sec) — Before touching the screen

**"Every team here built Document 1 — the pre-interview brief.**

**Look at the case files you gave us. Each one has four documents:
a brief, a raw transcript, field notes, and a structured intelligence schema.**

**Most teams generate Document 1 and stop. We generate all four —
and the system gets smarter after every conversation.**

**Let me show you."**

---

### Part 1: Generate (60 sec)

*[Type GridFlex Energy + URL → click Generate]*
*[Switch to pre-loaded GridFlex brief while it generates]*

**"AXIS ran six AI calls in parallel — research, Texas ecosystem analysis,
question generation, gap mapping, brief assembly, and something new:
it pre-filled the Document 4 intelligence schema from public data."**

*[Show brief → scroll to ⚠️ What AI Likely Got Wrong section]*

**"This section is the most important thing we built.**

**Our AI assumed GridFlex was a VPP battery operator and infrastructure company.
That's completely wrong.**

**The founder's first sentence corrects everything: 'We're a sales and
marketing company. We don't own a single piece of hardware.'**

**AXIS flagged this assumption and turned it into your opening question:
'Our research suggested you operate VPP infrastructure — how accurate is that?'**

**That question alone replaces 15 minutes of icebreaking."**

---

### Part 2: The Intelligence Schema (75 sec)

*[Click Schema tab]*

**"Here's what no other team built."**

**"This is Document 4 — the Texas Insights Schema from your case files.
The knowledge graph output you actually need.**

**AXIS pre-fills it from public research:**
- Business model type: distribution — not hardware, not SaaS
- Primary constraint: fulfillment, not demand
- ERCOT exposure: high — deregulation is the structural unlock
- Strategic tension: Texas domination vs multi-state expansion

**Every field it couldn't confirm is flagged orange: 'To verify in interview.'
The interviewer knows exactly what to listen for."**

*[Point to orange fields]*

**"After the call, the interviewer fills 4 fields. 3 minutes.
Goes straight into the knowledge graph."**

*[Click Post-Interview tab → show debrief form]*

**"What did AI get wrong? Key insights? Questions that worked? Surprises?
That's your ground truth — the thing no scraper can find."**

---

### Part 3: The Executive Email (30 sec)

*[Click Email tab]*

**"We also generate an email to send the executive before the call.**

**Zero effort from them. No survey. No toggles.**

**They just read it, see that you did real homework, and show up
to a better conversation. The subject line alone signals something different."**

---

### Part 4: Institutional Memory (45 sec)

**"Here's why this compounds."**

**"Every other system forgets everything when the call ends.**
**AXIS remembers.**

**After this GridFlex interview, the next team interviewing a Texas
energy company sees: 'AI assumed VPP operator — they're actually a
distribution layer. Ask about installer concentration risk, not hardware.'**

**After 10 interviews, Levi's team has sector patterns that no
Google search can surface. After 50, it's a proprietary intelligence
asset for Texas A&M.**

**Day 1 value: great prep tool.**
**Day 100 value: the best Texas business intelligence system that exists."**

---

### Closing (30 sec)

*[Step back from screen]*

**"Every other team built a preparation tool.**
**We built the research infrastructure that Texas A&M's interview program
compounds on over time.**

**We didn't just answer the prompt.**
**We built what Levi's program actually needs to scale."**

---

## Judge Q&A

**"How is this different from Googling?"**
> "Google gives raw information. AXIS gives interview-ready intelligence,
> sequenced with coaching, gap-mapped, and pre-filled into the Document 4
> schema your program actually needs. In 90 seconds."

**"Shouldn't the interviewee engage too?"**
> "Levi confirmed in Q&A that executives do zero work. Our info email
> respects their time. The 'what did AI get wrong?' opener gets the same
> correction without any pre-work from them."

**"How do you validate schema accuracy?"**
> "Every uncertain field is explicitly flagged 'To verify in interview' —
> the system is honest about its limits. That transparency guides the
> interviewer to exactly the right questions."

**"Why six Bedrock calls?"**
> "Each has a different temperature and job. Research synthesis needs 0.2
> for accuracy. Question generation needs 0.7 for creativity. Chaining
> them produces dramatically better output than one giant prompt."

## Backup Plan

1. Record a 3-minute screen recording tonight — full demo flow
2. If live demo breaks, play video and narrate over it
3. Pre-load all tabs before walking in:
   - Brief tab: GridFlex brief open
   - Schema tab: Document 4 schema showing
   - Email tab: info email formatted
   - Post-Interview: debrief already completed
