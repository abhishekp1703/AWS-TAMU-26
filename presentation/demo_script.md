## 📋 Questions to Ask Levi at 9:00 AM Q&A

Ask these in order. Listen hard — his answers may change what you build.

**Question 1** ← Most important
> "Levi, when interviews fall flat, is the bigger issue the interviewer not being 
> prepared — or the interviewee not knowing what to expect from the conversation?"

*Why ask this: If he says interviewee, your microsite becomes your #1 talking point.
If he says interviewer, lead with the brief and coaching rationale.*

**Question 2**
> "Do you have any existing data from past interviews we could use as sample 
> institutional memory — even just notes or summaries?"

*Why ask this: Real data makes your demo 10x more convincing. If yes, ask for it immediately.*

**Question 3**
> "When you imagine using this system 6 months from now, what would make you say 
> it was worth building?"

*Why ask this: Judges reveal their real success criteria. Take notes.*

**Question 4**
> "Is there a specific Texas industry sector you most want to crack — 
> energy, agriculture, tech?"

*Why ask this: Tailor your demo company to exactly what they care about.*

## 🎬 Demo Script (4 minutes 30 seconds)

Practice this until you can do it without notes.

---

### Opening (30 seconds) — Say this before touching the computer

> "Every team here will show you a tool that generates interview questions. 
> We thought about the problem differently.
>
> The real failure in these interviews isn't the questions — it's that busy 
> Texas executives sit down with students who spend the first 15 minutes 
> asking 'so what does your company do?' 
>
> That's insulting. And it's why executives stop taking these meetings.
>
> We asked: what would make a Texas CEO actually look forward to this 
> conversation before it even starts?"

*[Switch to the live app]*

### Part 1: Generate the Brief (60 seconds)

> "I'm a Texas A&M student. I have 5 minutes before an interview with H-E-B.
> I type the company name..."

*[Type H-E-B, add heb.com, click Generate]*

> "AXIS is now pulling public data, analyzing the Texas retail ecosystem, 
> generating questions with coaching built in, and identifying our blind spots.
> This takes about 90 seconds."

*[Switch to pre-loaded H-E-B brief while the live one generates]*

> "Here's what that looks like."

*[Show the brief — scroll briefly through it]*

> "Notice it's not just questions. Every question comes with why it works, 
> what a good answer sounds like, and how to probe if they're vague.
> A first-year student gets the same tools a seasoned interviewer has."

---

### Part 2: The Interviewee Microsite — YOUR BIG MOMENT (90 seconds)

> "But here's what no other team built."

*[Click the interviewee link, show it loading on screen]*

> "This is what the H-E-B executive received before our call. 
> Not a PDF. Not an email. A personalized microsite.
>
> They can see the 5 things our AI believes about their company.
> And with one click — they can tell us we're wrong."

*[Click "Needs correction" on a fact]*

> "They can select which questions actually interest them."

*[Select 2 questions]*

> "And we ask them: what's the one thing you wish interviewers understood 
> about your industry that they never ask?"

*[Show the wildcard text box]*

> "When they submit this — which takes them 3 minutes — 
> watch what happens on the interviewer side."

*[Switch to brief dashboard — show the response banner]*

> "The interviewer gets notified immediately. They see exactly what the AI 
> got wrong — which becomes their warm opening question. 
> They see which topics the CEO actually wants to discuss.
> And they have an unprompted insight the AI never could have generated.
>
> The interview starts warm before anyone says hello."

---

### Part 3: Institutional Memory (45 seconds)

> "One more thing. Every other system forgets everything the moment the 
> interview ends.
>
> AXIS remembers."

*[Show or describe the institutional memory panel]*

> "After every interview, the team logs what they learned — what the AI got 
> wrong, what questions landed, what surprised them.
>
> The next student who interviews a Texas retail company doesn't start 
> from zero. They start with everything the last 10 interviews taught us.
>
> After 50 interviews, Levi's team has something no search engine can give them — 
> proprietary intelligence about Texas business ecosystems that compounds 
> over time."

---

### Closing (30 seconds)

*[Back to slides or just stand up straight]*

> "Every other team built a preparation tool. Its value on day 100 is the 
> same as day 1.
>
> AXIS gets smarter with every conversation. 
>
> We didn't build a prep tool. We built relationship infrastructure for 
> Texas A&M's interview program."

*[Pause. Let it land.]*

## ❓ Likely Judge Questions + Your Answers

**"How is this different from just Googling the company?"**
> "Google gives you raw information. AXIS gives you interview-ready intelligence — 
> structured, sequenced, with coaching on how to use it. And the interviewee 
> microsite is something Google can never do."

**"What happens when Bedrock gets something wrong?"**
> "That's actually a feature, not a bug. The interviewee packet specifically 
> invites them to correct us — and that correction becomes the warmest possible 
> conversation opener. We turn AI imperfection into rapport."

**"How does this scale across different industries?"**
> "The prompts are industry-agnostic but Texas-context aware. We tested on 
> retail, energy, and manufacturing. The Texas context layer pulls relevant 
> sector trends regardless of industry."

**"Why not use Kendra for institutional memory?"**
> "Kendra is in our phase 2 roadmap for production scale. For the core 
> functionality we need — sector-based retrieval of past insights — DynamoDB 
> with structured queries gets us there with much faster setup time."

**"What's your data privacy story?"**
> "All data stays in the Texas A&M AWS account. Interviewee responses are 
> stored encrypted in S3. No data leaves the university's control."

**"How long does it take?"**
> "60 to 90 seconds from company name to complete brief. We tested it."

## 🚨 Backup Plan

If the live demo breaks:

1. **Play the pre-recorded video** (record tonight — 3 min screen capture)
2. **Narrate over it** exactly as if it were live
3. **Say:** "We recorded this earlier today to show you the full flow" — 
   judges don't care, they're evaluating the idea

**Pre-load before presenting:**
- Have H-E-B brief already generated and open in a tab
- Have the interviewee microsite already filled out with fake responses
- Have the interviewer dashboard showing "Interviewee responded"

Never demo a cold pipeline in a live presentation if you can avoid it.
